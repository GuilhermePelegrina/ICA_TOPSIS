## Introduction

We propose a novel approach whose aim is to estimate, from the observed data, a set of independent latent criteria, which can be seen as an alternative representation of the original decision matrix. A central element of our approach is to formulate the decision problem as a blind source separation problem, which allows us to apply independent component analysis techniques to estimate the latent criteria. Moreover, we consider TOPSIS-based approaches to obtain the ranking of alternatives from the latent criteria.

## Execution Steps

All the files in this repository are in .m format, so it is necessary to execute them in a Matlab (v. 2015a) or Octave Environment

1) Clone the repository 
2) Execute the file "main_$$$.m", where $$$ is the name of the analysis that you would like to conduct
3) The dataset used are also in this folder
